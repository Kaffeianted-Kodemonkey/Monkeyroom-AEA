    <p>At Kaffeinated Kodemonkey, we prioritize accessibility and believe that all products should meet the highest
    standards of ADA Compliance. To achieve this, we follow a rigorous process that involves the use of A11y tools,
    screen readers, and various assistive technologies aligned with our <strong>Accessibility Evaluation Audit (AEA)</strong>
    process.</p>

    <p>As an A11y Developer or Kodemonkey, your role is crucial in ensuring that products meet or exceed accessibility
    standards. You will evaluate the product following the <strong>A11y Evaluation Audit Guidlines</strong>, using
    <strong>screen readers, mobile devices, assistive technologies, WAVE,</strong> and any specified technologies
    outlined in the project scope.</p>

    <p>Before diving into any projects, it's crucial to thoroughly review the project scope. This will provide clarity
    on the level of compliance required, whether it's <strong>WCAG/508, WCAG only, AA, or AAA</strong>.
    Additionally, take note of any required or suggested testing methods unique to the project.</p>

    <h2>Getting started with the <strong><em>AEA</em></strong> process:</h2>
    <p>To streamline the AEA process, we understand the impracticality of conducting a manual evaluation on every page of a large site.
    Therefore, within the project scope, you'll receive an Audit Report outlining the current status of the project. It's suggested to
    kickstart the AEA reporting by verifying these results.</p>

    <p>For most sites utilizing templates/themes, key items to review include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Site templates</li>
      <li>Interactive forms</li>
      <li>Dynamic content pages</li>
      <li>Pages with dialog modals and alert notifications</li>
      <li>Key entry and exit pages (including account login and recovery pages)</li>
      <li>Any pages that process payments</li>
      <li>Help and assistance pages</li>
    </ul>
