  <p>Kaffeinated Kodemonkey's A11y Evaluation Audit process incorporates the DHS Trusted Tester process as an essential component of our workflow.
  We have diligently integrated the principles and guidelines outlined by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Tester program to ensure a
  robust and comprehensive evaluation of accessibility standards.</p>

  <p>However, it is important to note that Kaffeinated Kodemonkey is an independent entity and is not affiliated, associated, endorsed, or sponsored by
  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). While we are committed to upholding the highest standards of accessibility and inclusivity, our organization
  operates separately from any government agency.</p>

  <p>Any references made to the DHS Trusted Tester process within our documentation, communications, or website are solely for the purpose of
  acknowledging its significance in our evaluation methodologies. Kaffeinated Kodemonkey remains solely responsible for the services provided and any
  outcomes derived from our A11y Evaluation Audit process.</p>

  <p>We urge all clients and users to seek official guidance and certifications directly from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or other
  authorized entities if necessary. Should you require any further clarification or information, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

  <p>Thank you for choosing Kaffeinated Kodemonkey for your accessibility needs.</p>
