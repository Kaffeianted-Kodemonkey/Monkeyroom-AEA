<p>At the initial release of this document, only the operating systems and browsers specified below were validated with the test
process and tools to ensure that results were consistent and accurate. The list of supported operating systems and browsers is
expected to grow. Please refer to the DHS Section 508 Compliance Testing Tools website at
<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/508-tools" target="_blank">DHS 508 Tools</a> for the most up-to-date
test environment information and the Trusted Tester Test Tool Installation Guide.</p>

        <p>Although Windows 10 and 11 and macOS are the only operating systems listed, no foreseeable issues due to using another operating
        system have been identified. The operating system has little to no impact on web testing results and is more dependent on the browser.</p>

<h2>Testing Tools</h2>
<p>The tools used in the Test Process (and Baseline tests) have been chosen based on several factors including ease of use, ease of teaching, and
  accuracy of results. They are also free to install and use. The tools assist the tester with verification of accessibility properties. This test
  process is essentially a code inspection for accessibility properties, but the tools reduce the need for a tester to view source code or have
  in-depth knowledge of programming languages.</p>

<p>If these tools cannot be used, e.g., due to technical or security limitations, other tools may be substituted if it can be demonstrated that
they provide equivalent results. Use of alternate tools must be supported by clearly documented test processes and test results showing how the
alternate tool is equivalent for each test in which it is used in this test process.</p>
