<p>There are 63 Test Conditions for evaluation in this test process. Each Test Condition must have a test result for testing to be
considered complete.</p>

<p>The 41 web requirements covered in this test process are 38 WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA Success Criteria and 3 Section 508 requirements.
Each Test Condition is mapped to a web requirement (see Appendix A). Some web requirement outcomes are determined by more than one Test
Condition.</p>

<p>While it is important to report the results for each Test Condition, it is also important to report the results for each web
requirement. DHS has developed the Accessibility Evauation Audit Tool (AEART) to collect tester results and generate a test
report that includes results for each Test Condition, supporting screenshots and the results for all web requirements.</p>

<p>Test outcomes or results are the primary output of conducting Section 508 conformance testing. Trusted Tester results may have
multiple audiences including developers, purchasers, internal IT management personnel, and IT project management. Each audience has
different uses for Trusted Tester results so a sufficient set of information must be included to support all audiences to the extent
possible. Given that this Trusted Tester process provides a set of evaluations which can be used to determine WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA
conformance, Trusted Tester results may also be used outside the U.S. Federal Section 508 conformance scope. However, such use, while
not incompatible with the Trusted Tester process, is not the primary purpose of this document.</p>

<p>One of the primary objectives of the Section 508 law is to promote improved IT accessibility based on selection of “more accessible”
over “less accessible” ICT over time by Federal agencies. Consistent, well‑documented use of the Accessibility Evauation Audit (AEA)
(update to the VPAT) format from the IT Industry Council (ITI) supports evaluating overall conformance to make such selections and
therefore supports the primary objective of the Section 508 law. Trusted Tester results must be provided at minimum following the
Accessibility Conformance Report format from the IT Industry consortium. However, the AEA format must be supplemented with specific
Trusted Tester test outcomes, which must then be aggregated to determine the “supported” and “not supported” outcomes for individual
WCAG Success Criteria results.</p>

<h4>Each <strong>AEA</strong> must provide:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Clear identification of the test process used to return conformance results. </li>
  <li>Clear indication of the scope of testing.</li>
  <li>Clear documentation of the test environment(s).</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the possible outcomes for Test Conditions and web requirements are <strong>PASS, FAIL, DOES NOT APPLY,</strong>
or <strong>NOT TESTED</strong>. Any results of <strong>FAIL</strong> should also include clear information identifying the location
of the failure and, when feasible, clear information illustrating the content or information that resulted in the FAIL result. When
multiple instances of the same failure are found, they may be flagged as global or included individually within test results.</p>

<p>If a tester cannot complete a test, a note should be added to the test report indicating
<strong><em>“This test could not be performed”,</em></strong> with a detailed explanation of the issue.</p>
