<p>Each of the Test Conditions included in each test section below is a statement that can be evaluated as TRUE or FALSE. The “How to Test” content included under each Test Condition provides instructions on how to evaluate whether content PASSES the condition:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If a Test Condition is TRUE for the content in question, then the content PASSES that Test Condition. </li>
  <li>If a Test Condition is FALSE for the content in question, then the content FAILS that Test Condition. </li>
  <li>A Test Condition DOES NOT APPLY (DNA) only if content does not exist that meets the conditions described in the “Identify Content” instructions at the beginning of each test section.</li>
  <li>In very limited instances specifically described in this test process, a Test Condition is NOT TESTED if content exists that meets the Identify Content criteria for a test, but a test cannot be performed due to limitations in available test tools.</li>
</ul>
