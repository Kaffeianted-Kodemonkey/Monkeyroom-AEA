<p>Section 508/WCAG 2.0 allows the use of conforming alternate version to meet conformance
requirements. When there are multiple versions of the content, only one version is required to be fully
conforming as described in this section.</p>

<p>WCAG defines a conforming alternate version (CAV) as a version that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Conforms at the designated level</li>
  <li>Provides all of the same information and functionality in the same human language</li>
  <li>Is up to date with the non-conforming content</li>
  <li>At least one of the following is true:
    <ul>
      <li>The conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an accessibility-supported mechanism</li>
      <li>The non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version</li>
      <li>The non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides a mechanism to reach the conforming version</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This test process covers the four parts of the definition of conforming alternate up to 4.1. In this test
process, it is not practical for the tester to find all of the paths to reach the non-conforming version;
therefore, it is not possible to accurately validate that the non-conforming version can only be reached
as described by 4.2 or 4.3. There may also be unknown paths to the non-conforming version that may be
outside of the scope of testing. For these reasons, this test process assumes access from the non-
conforming version (4.1 in the CAV definition) and does not cover 4.2 or 4.3.<?p>

<p>This Conforming Alternate Version section deviates from the other tests in this process in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This section instructs the tester to perform tests in other sections. (See 1.A.)</li>
  <li>Conformance test results should be tracked and recorded under the respective Test IDs
  contained in the remainder of this document. At the end of this section, the tester will indicate if
  conforming alternate version(s) exists, using the results from this section combined with the test
  results from the remaining Test IDs.</li>
  <li>If found, a conforming alternate version essentially replaces the non-conforming versions of that
  content when determining the scope of conformance and reporting conformance results.</li>
  <li>Non-conforming content that has a conforming alternate version is only tested for the non-
  interference standards.</li>
</ul>

  <p>Reference this section whenever alternate versions of content are found.</p>

  <p>The process for determining whether a conforming alternate version exists can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find the version identified as the conforming alternate version.</li>
    <li>For that version:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Check if the identified version passes all tests in this test process (sections 2-20)</li>
        <li>Check for equivalence of the identified version</li>
        <li>Check for a conforming access mechanism</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Based on these test results:
      <ol type="a">
        <li>If all tests pass, it is a conforming alternate version.
          <ol type="i">
            <li> Test the non-conforming versions for non-interference</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If any tests fail, it is not a conforming alternate version.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>Although the identified version must pass all tests in Step 2 to be considered a Conforming Alternate
  Version, testers should continue testing even if a failure is found in Step 2.a so that any failures of 2.b or
  2.c can be reported in the same report for remediation.</p>

  <p>  A test report should indicate that in cases when the identified version fails any of the tests required to
  be considered the conforming alternate version, the nonconforming version is still limited to only the
  non-interference tests. While this deviates from WCAG’s Understanding Conformance, this process
  assumes that the identified version will be remediated to pass all the conforming alternate version
  requirements.</p>

  <p>Per WCAG 2.1, accessible versions should be identified, e.g., through a label on the page, as a link, in documentation, user
  preferences, controls to modify text appearance, etc. It may be helpful to review product documentation for information about
  accessible versions or enabling accessibility.</p>

  <p>Alternate versions may be provided for a part of the page, entire pages, or an entire site. A web page or site may have more
  than one version of content or features. It is also possible that a site has more than one instance of conforming alternate version.
  The following are some indications that content is provided in more than one way.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Content is identified as the accessible version</li>
    <li>Instructions are provided that describe how to enable accessibility</li>
    <li>Multiple methods are provided to complete a task (e.g., a calendar widget and a text field are provided for a user to enter a date)</li>
    <li>A link’s destination is an accessible alternate version or a version for assistive technology (e.g., screen reader version)</li>
    <li>User preferences or settings are provided to enable accessibility</li>
    <li>User controls exist to modify colors and text appearance</li>
  </ul>

  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions" target="_blank">Per WCAG's definition</a>,
  the identified version “does not need to reside within the scope of conformance, or even on the same web site, as long as it is as freely
  available as the non-conforming version.” However, the scope of testing with this process is limited to web-based alternatives that are
  available on a desktop computer. Alternate versions do not include mobile applications that can only be accessed on a mobile device.</p>

  <p>If there is more than one version and none are identified as the conforming alternate version/accessible version, assume there is no
  conforming alternate version and that these Conforming Alternate Version tests DO NOT APPLY. Perform tests 2 through 20 on all versions.</p>

          It may also be possible to “hide” non-conforming content from AT and/or exclude it from keyboard focus, thereby limiting access only
