        <h3>Identify Content</h3>
        <p>Per WCAG 2.1, accessible versions should be identified, e.g., through a label on the page, as a link, in documentation, user
        preferences, controls to modify text appearance, etc. It may be helpful to review product documentation for information about
        accessible versions or enabling accessibility.</p>

        <p>Alternate versions may be provided for a part of the page, entire pages, or an entire site. A web page or site may have more
        than one version of content or features. It is also possible that a site has more than one instance of conforming alternate version.
        The following are some indications that content is provided in more than one way.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Content is identified as the accessible version</li>
          <li>Instructions are provided that describe how to enable accessibility</li>
          <li>Multiple methods are provided to complete a task (e.g., a calendar widget and a text field are provided for a user to enter a date)</li>
          <li>A link’s destination is an accessible alternate version or a version for assistive technology (e.g., screen reader version)</li>
          <li>User preferences or settings are provided to enable accessibility</li>
          <li>User controls exist to modify colors and text appearance</li>
        </ul>

        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions" target="_blank">Per WCAG's definition</a>,
        the identified version “does not need to reside within the scope of conformance, or even on the same web site, as long as it is as freely
        available as the non-conforming version.” However, the scope of testing with this process is limited to web-based alternatives that are
        available on a desktop computer. Alternate versions do not include mobile applications that can only be accessed on a mobile device.</p>

        <p>If there is more than one version and none are identified as the conforming alternate version/accessible version, assume there is no
        conforming alternate version and that these Conforming Alternate Version tests DO NOT APPLY. Perform tests 2 through 20 on all versions.</p>

        </ul>

        <h4>How to Test:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Enable accessibility settings (if necessary), select, and/or navigate to the version of content identified as the accessible alternate version. </li>
          <li>Following this test process, test the identified version of the content for all applicable Test Conditions. Record the result for the appropriate Test ID.
            <ol type="a">
              <li>If no failures are found, this may be a conforming alternate version.</li>

        <h4>Evaluate Results:</h4>

          <li>The identified version of content passes all applicable Test Conditions in this test process.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3><strong>Note:</strong></h3>
        <p>Alternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments or user groups.
        At least one version would need to pass all Test Conditions.</p>

          <li>Applicable mechanism tests may include Links and Buttons, Headings, Forms, and/or other tests.</li>
          <li>The mechanism to access the conforming version should directly or indirectly indicate that it leads to the accessible version.
          For example, text preceding a link to the accessible version might directly state that the link leads to the accessible version.
          It may also be possible to “hide” non-conforming content from AT and/or exclude it from keyboard focus, thereby limiting access only
          to the accessible version for users with disabilities. Such an approach, however, may not be possible, depending on the content.</li>
          <li>The mechanism may be explicitly provided in the content or may be relied upon to be provided by either the platform or by user
          agents, including assistive technologies.</li>
