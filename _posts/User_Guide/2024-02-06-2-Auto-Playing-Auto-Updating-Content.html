        <h4>Applicability:</h4>
        <p>This Test Condition <strong>DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)</strong> if there is no audio content that plays automatically for more
        than 3 seconds.</p>

        <h4>How to Test:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Determine if there is a mechanism within the first three elements encountered for the user to pause or stop the audio or
          to control the volume of only the auto-playing audio.
            <ol type="a">
              <li>The browser should already have been configured to allow auto-play. (See the Test Tool Installation and Configuration
              Guide for instructions.)</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Activate the mechanism.</li>
          <li>Following this test process, test the mechanism for all applicable Test Conditions.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Evaluate Results: </h4>
        <p>If <strong>ALL</strong> of the following are <strong>TRUE</strong>, then the content <strong>PASSES</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>There is a mechanism that can pause or stop the audio or control the volume of only the auto-playing audio,
          <strong>AND</strong></li>
          <li>The mechanism is within the first three elements encountered by the user, <strong>AND</strong></li>
          <li>The mechanism passes all applicable Test Conditions in this test process.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Notes: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The Trusted Tester process requires the mechanism within three elements for clear measurability. This requirement is not
          specified in WCAG. To meet the non-interference requirement, the mechanism can be a focusable element or text instructions at
          the top of the page prior to repetitive content</li>
          <li>A browser’s ability to disable auto-playing media and/or mute a specific tab are acceptable mechanisms to stop or control
          the volume of auto-playing audio content. However, not all browsers have the capability to disable auto-playing media or mute
          specific windows or tabs.</li>

        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>WCAG SC 2.2.2 does not apply to auto-updating of information where the auto-updating is essential. However, the auto-updating
          of a stock ticker that conveys real-time information would not be considered essential (per WCAG) so it would be included in this
          test. It is likely that most instances of auto-update would not be essential. To avoid incorrect omission(s) of content from this
          test, the tester is not tasked with determining whether auto-updating is essential and should include all content that meets the
          Identify Content description. A Section 508 exception may be applied for essential auto-updating content; however, this is outside
          the scope of the testing process. An exception for SC 2.2.2 should be considered carefully as Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference
          equires its conformance.</li>
          <li>When displayed content moves, blinks or scrolls, but the content itself does not change, only Test 2.B,
          2.2.2-blinking-moving-scrolling applies.</li>
          <li>When there is auto-updating content where the content itself changes (e.g., in a carousel, stock tickers, updating sports scores),
