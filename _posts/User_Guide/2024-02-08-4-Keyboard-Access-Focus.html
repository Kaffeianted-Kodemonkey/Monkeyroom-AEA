        <h3>Identify Content</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Use the mouse or other pointing device to determine available functions provided by interactive elements (including drop-down menus, form fields, revealing/hiding content, tooltips, AND all interactive interface components).</li>

        <h4>Note: </h4>
        <p>WCAG SC 2.1.1 requirement does not apply to functions that require input that depends on the path of the user’s movement and not just the endpoints. For this test process, the tester is not tasked with identifying and omitting these types of functions. The tester should include all functions that meet the Identify Content description. A Section 508 exception may be applied for certain functions; however, this is outside the scope the testing process.</p>
        <p>If there is no such content, the result for the following test <strong>ID(s)</strong> is <strong>DOES NOT APPLY:</strong> 4.A to 4.H.</p>

        <h4>Applicability:</h4>
        <p>This Test Condition <strong>DOES NOT APPLY (DNA)</strong> if the page has no user activated functionality.</p>

        <h4>How to Test:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Identify the functionality and essential information provided by interactive elements.
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Possible ways to identify functionality include: mouse, touch screen, voice commands, and documentation of functionality (e.g., of shortcut keys). </li>
              <li>The “title attributes” feature in ANDI: focusable elements can help identify any essential information contained in title attributes.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Use the keyboard to operate identified functionality and/or access the essential information: access (e.g., tab to) the element and execute (e.g., press Enter with focus on the element).
            <ol type="a">
              <li>For interactive elements with title attributes, place keyboard focus on the element. If the tooltip does not appear within two seconds, keyboard focus will not reveal the title information.</li>
              <li>If an interactive element does not have keyboard access, determine if there is another keyboard accessible method available on the page which provides the same functionality, e.g., one of two print methods provided is keyboard accessible, etc. [See Conforming Alternate Version for further details.]</li>
              <li>If an interactive element does not provide access to essential information via keyboard interaction, determine whether the information is available elsewhere on the page (e.g., as text).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Not all browsers visually display the title attribute as a tooltip when an element has keyboard focus.</li>
          <li>Shortcut keys are typically documented on the page or in the Help documentation so that they are discoverable by a user.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Evaluate Results:</h4>
        <p>If <strong>BOTH</strong> of the following are <strong>TRUE</strong>, the content <strong>PASSES</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>All functionality can be accessed and executed using the keyboard, <strong>AND</strong></li>
          <li>All essential information can be accessed via keyboard interaction OR the information is available elsewhere on the page.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Any changes to functionality that occur automatically or as a result of interaction with the page should be included in this test.</li>
          <li>Information is considered essential or required when the information is necessary to execute an action or understand information and relationships.</li>

        <h4>How to Test:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Use standard navigation keys (e.g., TAB, SHIFT + TAB, arrow keys, CTRL + TAB, etc.) to navigate through all keyboard focusable elements on the page.</li>
          <li>Determine whether there are any instances where keyboard navigation becomes trapped:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Keyboard users are unable to move away from an element, e.g., using a TAB or arrow key</li>
              <li>Keyboard access is restricted to a small section of the page with no way to navigate out of the “loop” to the rest of the page. Note:
                <ul>
                  <li> Keyboard focus should remain within a modal dialog box until it is closed (per Test ID 4.F Step 3). However, check for keyboard traps in the dialog.</li>
                  <li>If a section of a page requires input or interaction before allowing focus to progress to the rest of the page, this is not a failure.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>If a keyboard trap is found:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li>Inspect any help (contextual help, or application help) and documentation for notification of available alternate keyboard commands (e.g., non-standard keyboard controls, access keys, hotkeys) to escape/avoid the keyboard trap. </li>
                  <li>Determine whether the alternate command(s) work.</li>

        <ol>
          <li>Keyboard focus can be moved away from an element using either:
            <ol type="a">
              <li>Standard navigation keys </li>
              <li>Custom keystrokes (which are documented and available to users in the application).</li>

              <li>Keyboard focus can be moved away from each section of the page containing elements (and are not trapped in a “loop”, preventing access to other elements on the page) by using either:

        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>To confirm keyboard focus is on a frame when there is not visible focus: use the <strong>TAB</strong> and <strong>SHIFT + TAB</strong> combination to deduce that the keyboard focus is on the frame. When on the frame, a tab forward should move focus to the first keyboard focusable element within the frame. From there, SHIFT + TAB once to move back to the frame and another SHIFT + TAB should move focus to a keyboard focusable element before the frame. Only the frame is permitted to not have a visible focus. Be certain it is the frame that does not have a visible focus and not another element.</p>

              <li>It may be necessary to use the keyboard to activate trigger controls that reveal hidden content with focusable elements (e.g., menus, dialogs, modal dialog boxes, expandable tree list) to check the focus order to, from, and within the revealed content.</li>
              <li>It may be helpful to launch ANDI: focusable elements and select tab order. </li>
