<p>For each of the standards, the criteria are listed by chapter in a table.  The structures of the tables are: the first column contains
the criteria being evaluated, the second column describes the level of conformance of the product regarding the criteria and the third column
contains any additional remarks and explanations regarding the product.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When sections of criteria do not apply, or are deemed by the customer as not applicable, the section is noted as such and the rest of that
  table may be removed for that section.</li>
  <li>When multiple standards are being recorded in this document, the duplicative sections are noted and responded to only one time.
  The duplicate entry will note the cross reference to the data.</li>
</ul>
